# 🤖 Data Logic and Automation (Store 2)

This project focuses on automating data processing tasks using Python. I transitioned from manual data manipulation to creating reusable functions and iterative logic to handle customer databases efficiently.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Functional Programming:** Developed custom functions to calculate age and format user strings.
- **Control Flow & Loops:** Implemented `for` loops and `if-elif-else` statements to categorize customers and calculate total revenue.
- **Data Filtering:** Extracted specific segments of users based on age and spending criteria.
- **Automation:** Created a logic flow that processes an entire list of users automatically instead of record-by-record.

## 📊 Key Achievements
- Built a robust age calculator that handles different data input formats.
- Automated the "Loyalty Category" assignment based on user spending thresholds.
- Optimized data extraction for targeted marketing segments.
