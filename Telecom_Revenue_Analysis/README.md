# 📞 Telecom Revenue & Statistical Analysis (Megaline)

This project focuses on identifying which prepaid plan (Surf vs. Ultimate) generates more revenue for Megaline. It involves processing usage data for 500 customers and applying statistical tests to validate business hypotheses.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted T-tests to compare means between independent groups (Revenue by plan and Revenue by region).
- **Data Aggregation & Transformation:** Grouping usage data by month to calculate calls, SMS, and data volume per user.
- **Revenue Modeling:** Created a custom function to calculate monthly revenue based on plan limits, overage fees, and subscription costs.
- **Outlier Management & Distribution Analysis:** Using histograms and boxplots to understand user behavior and filter out noise.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Revenue Distribution:** Statistical analysis revealed whether the difference in average revenue between plans was statistically significant or merely due to random variation.
- **Regional Insights:** Tested the hypothesis that users in the NY-NJ area have different spending habits than users in other regions.
- **Plan Optimization:** Provided data-backed recommendations on where the commercial department should focus its advertising budget.
