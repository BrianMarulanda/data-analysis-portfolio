# 🎟️ Marketing Optimization & Unit Economics (Showz)

This project focuses on optimizing marketing expenses for "Showz," an event ticket seller. I analyzed user behavior, purchase conversion funnels, and marketing profitability to determine which advertising sources provide the best Return on Investment (ROI).

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Unit Economics:** Calculated key business metrics including **LTV** (Lifetime Value), **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost), and **ROMI** (Return on Marketing Investment).
- **Cohort Analysis:** Tracked user behavior over time to identify when customers start buying and how their value evolves.
- **Conversion Funnels:** Analyzed the path from the first visit to the first purchase to identify friction points.
- **Advanced Data Aggregation:** Managed and merged three distinct datasets (Visits, Orders, and Costs) to create a unified profitability view.

## 📊 Business Insights
- **Profitability by Source:** Identified specific marketing channels that achieved a positive ROMI and those that were losing money.
- **Customer Lifecycle:** Determined the average time it takes for a user to convert and when the company typically reaches the "break-even" point for a new customer.
- **Strategic Recommendation:** Provided data-backed advice on where to reallocate the marketing budget to maximize total revenue.
