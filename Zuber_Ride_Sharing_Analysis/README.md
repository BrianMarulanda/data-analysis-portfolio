# 🚕 Zuber: Ride-Sharing Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

This project analyzes taxi ride data in Chicago to help a new ride-sharing company, Zuber, understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors (like weather) on trip duration.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **SQL Data Extraction:** Utilized SQL to retrieve and filter data from multiple tables regarding neighborhood drop-offs and company trip counts.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Applied **T-tests** to determine if the average duration of rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes significantly on rainy Saturdays.
- **Data Distribution Analysis:** Identified the top 10 neighborhoods for drop-offs and visualized market share among taxi companies.
- **Statistical Significance:** Interpreted p-values to make data-driven decisions regarding operational impacts.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Market Dominance:** Flash Cab and Taxi Affiliation Services lead the market in total trip volume.
- **Top Destinations:** The "Loop", "River North", and "Streeterville" are the highest-demand neighborhoods, suggesting where Zuber should concentrate its fleet.
- **Weather Correlation:** Statistically confirmed that rainy weather significantly impacts ride duration, which is crucial for dynamic pricing models.
