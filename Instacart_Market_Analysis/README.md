# 🛒 Instacart Market Basket Analysis

This project involves a deep dive into Instacart's grocery delivery data to uncover shopping patterns, product popularity, and customer retention metrics. I handled multiple interconnected datasets to simulate a real-world business intelligence environment.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Complex Data Merging:** Utilizing `merge()` and `concat()` to combine information across orders, products, and aisles.
- **Advanced EDA:** Analyzing distributions of order times (hour of the day / day of the week) to identify peak demand periods.
- **Customer Behavior Metrics:** Calculating "Reorder Rates" and "Cart Addition Order" to understand product urgency and brand loyalty.
- **Data Integrity at Scale:** Managing large datasets by identifying and resolving implicit duplicates and handling significant missing value gaps.

## 📊 Business Insights
- **Peak Hour Analysis:** Identified that most orders occur between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, suggesting optimal windows for logistics and staffing.
- **Retention Trends:** Analyzed how many days typically pass between orders, providing insights for personalized push notifications and marketing.
- **Product Flow:** Discovered which items (like perishables) are usually added first to the cart, indicating high-intent purchase categories.
