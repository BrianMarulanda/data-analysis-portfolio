# 🎵 Music Consumer Behavior Analysis

This project marks the transition from basic Python structures to professional data manipulation using the **Pandas** library. I analyzed a dataset of music streaming services to compare user preferences between two cities (Springfield and Shelbyville) and identify patterns based on the day of the week.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Pandas DataFrames:** Loading, inspecting, and manipulating structured data from CSV files.
- **Advanced Data Cleaning:** - Identifying and filling missing values (NaN) in critical columns like `track`, `artist`, and `genre`.
    - Detecting and removing both explicit and implicit duplicates (e.g., unifying "hip", "hop", and "hip-hop" into a single category).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Formulating hypotheses and testing them by filtering data by city and time.
- **Data Grouping & Aggregation:** Using `groupby()` and `count()` to compare activity levels across different demographics.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Temporal Patterns:** Activity levels vary significantly by day, with Fridays showing peak engagement in certain regions.
- **Regional Preferences:** Springfield and Shelbyville exhibit different musical "prime times," which is crucial for targeted marketing strategies.
