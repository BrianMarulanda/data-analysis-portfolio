# 🚗 Used Vehicles Interactive Dashboard

This project moves beyond static analysis to web deployment. I built an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** and **Plotly** to allow users to explore a dataset of 50,000+ used vehicle listings in the US.

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- **Web App Deployment:** Developed a functional web application using the Streamlit framework.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Implemented dynamic Plotly charts (Scatter plots, histograms, and treemaps) that respond to user filters.
- **Software Engineering Best Practices:** Managed dependencies using `requirements.txt` and organized code for local/cloud execution.
- **User Interface (UI) Design:** Built sidebar filters to allow non-technical users to query data by vehicle type, condition, and model year.

## 📊 Key Features
- Dynamic price vs. mileage correlation analysis.
- Real-time inventory metrics and data filtering.
- Capability to download filtered datasets directly from the browser.
